## JS BallsDex

This bot is inspired from [BallsDex](https://github.com/Ballsdex-Team/BallsDex-DiscordBot) (made by [Laggron 42](https://github.com/laggron42)), made with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and uses Docker to function.

This code is a complete recreation of the bot, written with the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) library, by [PwLDev](https://github.com/PwLDev) and [Valen7440](https://github.com/Valen7440) and behaves exactly the same as BallsDex (does not include battles).
